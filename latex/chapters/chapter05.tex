\chapter{Application: gravitational radiation from birefringent matter dynamics}
\label{chapter_weak_area}

\textit{So far, we have developed the general framework of covariant constructive gravity and derived a perturbative equivalent. A few examples illustrated the constructions, but the presentation focused on broad applicability to various geometries, without any specific bundle or matter theory in mind. In this chapter, we shift our focus and consider in depth the application of the framework to generalized linear electrodynamics, a birefringent generalization of Maxwell electrodynamics introduced in Chapter \ref{chapter_construction_algorithm}. Applying the perturbative construction procedure to third order yields gravitational field equations to second order. We will carefully analyze a $3+1$ split for the linear part of this theory and restrict to a certain sector with, in a very specific sense, physically sane phenomenology. Afterwards, we solve the two-body problem to first order and obtain the orbits of a binary system in area metric gravity. Building up on this solution, the second order of the field equations is used to derive the emission of gravitational radiation from the binary system and the radiative loss, which causes spin-up of the system. The binary star subject to area metric gravity turns out to exhibit qualitatively new behaviour as compared to Einstein gravity, e.g.~additional massive modes of gravitational radiation or a modification of Kepler's third law.}

\textit{To a large extent, the work presented in this chapter has been published as Ref.~\cite{grav_rad_paper}. The results on radiation loss are not part of the previous publication.}

\section{Area metric gravity}
The matter theory in question is generalized linear electrodynamics (GLED) as defined in Def.~\ref{def_gled} with the Lagrangian density
\begin{equation}\label{lagrangian_gled}
  L_\text{GLED} = \omega_G G^{abcd} F_{ab} F_{cd},
\end{equation}
where we choose without loss of generality the scalar density
\begin{equation}\label{area_density}
  \omega_G = \left(\frac{1}{24}\epsilon_{abcd}G^{abcd}\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
The principal polynomial of GLED is quartic and takes the form
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal P_\text{GLED}(k) = -\frac{1}{24} \omega_G^2 \epsilon_{mnpq} \epsilon_{rstu} G^{mnra} G^{bpsc} G^{dqtu} k_a k_b k_c k_d.
\end{equation}
As appropriate Lorentz invariant expansion point constructed from the Minkowski metric $\eta$, we already determined in Example \ref{example_expansion_points}
\begin{equation}\label{area_expansion_point}
  N^A = J_{abcd}^A (\eta^{ac} \eta^{bd} - \eta^{ad} \eta^{bc} + \epsilon^{abcd}).
\end{equation}
Before solving the system of equivariance equations perturbatively around $N$, let us reconsider the reduced power series ansatz \eqref{ansatz_reduced}. In addition to dropping terms with a total number of derivatives that is odd or greater than 2, and dropping non-Lorentz invariant expansion coefficients, we can also discard the linear term $a_A H^A$. This term would yield a constant in the Euler-Lagrange equations, causing the flat expansion point $N$ to no longer constitute a solution to the vacuum field equations. However, the perturbation ansatz stipulates that we perturb around a solution of the field equations. Since it is obvious that Equation \eqref{prolong_0} implies from vanishing coefficients $a_A$ that also the coefficient $a$ vanishes, we readily drop both and make the further reduced ansatz
\begin{equation}\label{ansatz_area_gravity}
  \begin{aligned}
    L &{} = a_A^{\hphantom AI} H^A_{\hphantom AI} \\
      &{} \hphantom{=} + a_{AB} H^A H^B + a_{A\hphantom pB}^{\hphantom Ap\hphantom Bq} H^A_{\hphantom Ap} H^B_{\hphantom Bq} + a_{AB}^{\hphantom{AB}I} H^A H^B_{\hphantom BI} \\
      &{} \hphantom{=} + a_{ABC} H^A H^B H^C + a_{AB\hphantom pC}^{\hphantom{AB}p\hphantom Cq} H^A H^B_{\hphantom Bp} H^C_{\hphantom Cq} + a_{ABC}^{\hphantom{ABC}I} H^A H^B H^C_{\hphantom CI} \\
      &{} \hphantom{=} + \mathcal O(H^4).
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\section{Solving axiom 1}
Step 1 of the perturbative construction algorithm \ref{perturbative_algorithm} consists in computing the Gotay-Marsden coefficients for the gravitational bundle. For area metric gravity, we found in Sect.~\ref{section_gled}
\begin{equation}
  \gmc{A}{B}{n}{m} = 4 I^{pqrn}_B J^A_{pqrm},
\end{equation}
which followed from the general result \eqref{gmc_contra} for purely contravariant tensor bundles.

Proceeding with step 2, we need to construct a basis for the Lorentz invariant expansion coefficients
\begin{equation}
  (a_A^{\hphantom AI}, a_{AB}, a_{A\hphantom pB}^{\hphantom Ap\hphantom Bq}, a_{AB}^{\hphantom{AB}I}, a_{ABC}, a_{AB\hphantom pC}^{\hphantom{AB}p\hphantom Cq}, a_{ABC}^{\hphantom{ABC}I})
\end{equation}
in the ansatz \eqref{ansatz_area_gravity}. This task is solved using the Haskell library \texttt{sparse-tensor} \cite{sparse-tensor} discussed in Chapter \ref{}. The result is a basis of dimension 237, enumerated in full in Appendix \ref{} and summarized in Table \ref{}. It should be emphasized that the requirement of Lorentz invariance, which is not a direct stipulation but follows via the equivariance equations from a physically motivated assumption about the expansion point, drastically reduces the dimensionality of the ansatz from
\begin{equation}
  210 + \frac{21\cdot 22}{2} + 21\cdot 210 + \frac{84\cdot 85}{2} + \frac{21\cdot 22\cdot 23}{6} + \frac{21\cdot 22}{2} \cdot  210 + 21\cdot\frac{84\cdot 85}{2} = 133672
\end{equation}
to only 237. In principle, the correctness of the ansatz can be verified by showing that it is the most generic solution to the ansatz equations \ref{}. All we have to show is that the dimensionality of the ansatz equals the corank of the linear system of ansatz equations. For the ansatz including third-order coefficients, the system is quite large---considering that the coefficient space is already of dimension 133672---such that, on standard hardware, the rank cannot be computed naively by storing the matrix in memory and using methods like singular value decomposition or fraction-free gaussian elimination. It is rather easy, however, to use the aforementioned methods and work out the corank of the linear system determining the Lorentz invariant ansatz coefficients to second order, as the dimension of this ansatz space is only $210 + \frac{21\cdot 22}{2} + 21 \cdot 210 + \frac{84\cdot 85}{2} = 8421$. Confirming the number of obtained basis ansätze up to second order, the corank of the corresponding system is indeed 40. The computer code for this computation is published as Ref.~\cite{second-order-area-repo}.

  \caption{Summary of the Lorentz invariant expansion coefficients for the area metric gravity ansatz \eqref{ansatz_area_gravity} obtained from the Haskell library \texttt{sparse-tensor} \cite{}. The dimension is the number of linearly independent basis tensors returned from the computer program. Assigning labels from $1$ to $237$ to all basis tensors, an ansatz is represented by real numbers $e_1\dots e_{237}$ using its unique basis decomposition. These numbers parameterize the gravitational theory and are thus referred to as \emph{gravitational constants}. For a complete picture of the decomposition of ansätze using basis tensors, refer to Appendix \ref{} or the computer code in Ref.~\cite{second-order-area-repo}.}
\end{table}

With the 237 ansatz coefficients at hand, solving the equivariance equations as required for step 5 is only a matter of inserting the ansatz in the system and its first two prolongations as displayed in Eqns.~\ref{prolong_0}--\ref{prolong_2}, extracting a system of linear equations for the gravitational constants, and solving this system. This task is again performed using efficient computer algebra, implemented in the Haskell library \texttt{safe-tensor}, which is introduced in Chapter \ref{}. The procedure is roughly as follows: A compatibility layer with \texttt{sparse-tensor} is used in order to construct the ansatz tensors and make them available as \texttt{Tensor} types with generalized rank (see Sect.~\ref{}). Together with predefined tensors like Kronecker deltas, intertwiners, Gotay-Marsden coefficients, or the Minkowski metric, the ansatz tensors are used in order to construct the (prolonged) equivariance equations evaluated at $N$ (Eqns.~\ref{prolong_0}--\ref{prolong_2}). Each tensorial equation is a value of type \texttt{Tensor} and, as such, can be evaluated into a list of its components. Every component is a linear equation for the 237 gravitational constants. Collecting all components for all tensorial equations, we obtain a matrix representing the linear system for the constants $e_1\dots e_{237}$. The system is small enough to be brought into reduced row echelon form applying fraction-free gaussian elimination and backward substitution using 64-bit integers\footnote{Exploiting the observation we made earlier that, using intertwiners with purely rational components, all coefficients in the system remain rational.}, which yields a solution that parameterizes the constants with a few remaining indeterminate gravitational constants. As an example for the process, let us walk through the solution for the linear expansion coefficient $a_A^{\hphantom AI}$.

\begin{example}[solution of the equivariance equations to first order]
  Having set $a_A = 0$, the remaining expansion coefficient for the linear order is $a_A^{\hphantom AI}$, which is determined in part by the second unprolonged equation \eqref{prolong_0}. A suitable basis for this coefficient is
  \begin{equation}
    a_A^{\hphantom AI} = J_A^{abcd} J_{pq}^I\lbrack e_1 \cdot \eta_{ac} \eta_{bd} \eta^{pq} + e_2 \cdot \eta_{ac} \delta_b^p \delta_d^q + e_3 \cdot \epsilon_{abcd} \eta^{pq} \rbrack
  \end{equation}
  with three gravitational constants $e_1,e_2,e_3$. Inserting this ansatz into the unprolonged equation
  \begin{equation}
    0 = a_A^{\hphantom AI} \gmc{A}{B}{(n}{m} J^{pq)}_I N^B =\vcentcolon T^{npq}_m
  \end{equation}
  yields a tensorial equation $0 = T^{npq}_m$ with 256 components. Each component is of the form
  \begin{equation}
    0 = c_1\cdot e_1  + c_2\cdot e_2 + c_3\cdot e_3.
  \end{equation}
  The collection of all components is a system of 256 linear equations for three variables. A lot of these equations are redundant, because they are trivial or linearly dependent. A naive reduction by eliminating trivial equations and choosing only one representative for equations that are multiples of each other already reduces the system to the single equation
  \begin{equation}
    0 = 2 e_1 + e_2 + 4 e_3.
  \end{equation}
  Setting e.g.~$e_2 = -2 e_1 -4 e_3$ solves the equivariance equation for the coefficient $a_A^{\hphantom AI}$, leaving it parameterized by two gravitational constants $e_1$ and $e_3$.
\end{example}

Applied to the whole system of equivariance equations, we obtain a parameterization of the solution (displayed in full in Appendix \ref{}) by 50 independent gravitational constants. A subset of 16 constants governs \emph{linearized} area metric gravity via the quadratic Lagrangian density, from which---as we will encounter later---only 11 independent linear combinations play a role for the Euler-Lagrange equations. The procedure outlined here is implemented in Haskell using the library \texttt{sparse-tensor} for ansatz generation as well as the library \texttt{safe-tensor} for constructing and solving the equivariance equations, with the source code and results published as Ref.~\cite{second-order-area-repo}.

\section{Solving axiom 2}
The pedestrian approach towards implementing causal compatibility of the just constructed gravitational theory with GLED is to carefully execute steps 6--12 of the perturbative construction algorithm. This way, we obtain an approximation of the area metric gravity principal polynomial and have to match the causal structure with a first-order expansion of the GLED principal polynomial. While entirely feasible, this approach is less illustrative than the \emph{constructive} approach we employ instead. The underlying realization behind this technique is that the diffeomorphism invariance of the gravitational theory dramatically restricts the possible principal polynomials. In fact, we will see that for third-order area metric Lagrangians, the admissible principal polynomials are already causally compatible with the corresponding expansion of the GLED polynomial. \emph{There is no causality mismatch left to be fixed.}

To this end, recall the GLED polynomial \eqref{gled_polynomial}, which using the scalar density \eqref{area_density} assumes the form
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal P_\text{GLED}(k) = -\frac{1}{\frac{1}{24}(\epsilon_{abcd}G^{abcd})^2} \epsilon_{mnpq} \epsilon_{rstu} G^{mnra} G^{bpsc} G^{dqtu} k_a k_b k_c k_d.
\end{equation}
Expanding this expression to linear order in the perturbation yields
\begin{equation}\label{gled_poly_first_order}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal P_\text{GLED}(k) &{} = \left\{ \left\lbrack 1 - \frac{1}{24} \epsilon(H) \right\rbrack \eta(k,k) + \frac{1}{2} H(k,k) \right\}^2 + \mathcal O(H^2) \\
                              &{} = \lbrack P^{(\leq 1)}_\text{GLED} \rbrack^2 + \mathcal O(H^2),
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the abbreviations
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon(H) = \epsilon_{abcd} H^{abcd}\quad\text{and}\quad H(k,k) = \eta_{ac} H^{abcd} k_b k_d
\end{equation}
have been introduced. In the following, we will also make use of the contraction
\begin{equation}
  \eta(H) = \eta_{ac} \eta_{bd} H^{abcd}.
\end{equation}
Up to first order, we find that the GLED polynomial factors into the square of a metric polynomial $P^{(\leq 1)}_\text{GLED}$. This has a remarkable consequence: For weak gravitational fields, where the approxmiation to first order is sufficiently good, the physics of point particles adhering to GLED dynamics is indistinguishable from the Maxwellian setting with a metric perturbation $h$ by virtue of the identification
\begin{equation}
  h^{ab} = \left\lbrack 1 - \frac{1}{24} \epsilon(H) \right\rbrack \eta^{ab} + \frac{1}{2} \eta_{cd}H^{acbd} = (P^{(\leq 1)}_\text{GLED})^{ab}.
\end{equation}
This effect only holds in the limit of geometric optics---the GLED field equations do \emph{not} reduce to Maxwell equations with a metric perturbation. Consequently, even to first order in the area metric perturbation, nonmetric effects can be observed. An in-depth study of classical and quantum electrodynamics on weakly birefringent backgrounds based on exactly this realization has been conducted in Ref.~\cite{quantum_gled}.

We will now proceed to show that the possible principal polynomials arising from third-order area metric gravity Lagrangians as constructed in the previous section are only mildly more general than the effectively quadratic first-order GLED polynomial \eqref{gled_poly_first_order}. This issue is approached by first considering the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop_euler_tensor}
  Let $E\overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow}M$ be a sub-bundle of some tensor bundle over $M$. Consider a Lagrangian field theory on $J^2\pi$ that is degenerate in the sense that the Euler-Lagrange equations are of second derivative order, i.e.~are also defined on $J^2\pi$. If the Lagrangian field theory is diffeomorphism invariant with respect to the diffeomorphism action on the second jet bundle, it follows that the Euler-Lagrange equations are diffeomorphism equivariant. In particular, a local representation of the Euler-Lagrange equations
  \begin{equation}\label{euler_lagrange_local_repeat}
  E_A = L_{:A} - D_p L_{:A}^{\hphantom{:A}p} + I_I^{pq} D_p D_q L_{:A}^{\hphantom{:A}I}
  \end{equation}
  exhibits the transformation behaviour
  \begin{equation}\label{trafo_euler_lagrange}
    \delta_\xi E_A = -E_A \xi^m_{,m} - E_B \gmc{B}{A}{n}{m} \xi^m_{,n},
  \end{equation}
  where $\gmc{B}{A}{n}{m}$ are the Gotay-Marsden coefficients corresponding to the field bundle. In other words, the Euler-Lagrange equations transform as tensor density of weight 1.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The claim follows from expanding the left hand side of Eq.~\ref{trafo_euler_lagrange} as
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_\xi E_A = E_{A:B} \delta_\xi u^B + E_{A:B}^{\hphantom{A:B}p} \delta_\xi u^B_{\hphantom Bp} + E_{A:B}^{\hphantom{A:B}I} \delta_\xi u^B_{\hphantom BI},
  \end{equation}
  then replacing $E_A$ with its definition \eqref{euler_lagrange_local_repeat} and simplifying the result using the equivariance of the Lagrangian density $L$. Rather than performing this tedious calculation, we can alternatively consider the geometric definition \ref{global_lagrange_form} of the Euler-Lagrange form and deduce that it must transform covariantly (for a contravariant tensor bundle) with density weight of one, i.e.~according to the local expression \eqref{trafo_euler_lagrange}.
\end{proof}
This transformation behaviour carries over to the principal symbol of the Euler-Lagrange equations, which is also a tensor density of weight 1.
\begin{proposition}
  Consider the same Lagrangian field theory as in Prop.~\ref{prop_euler_tensor}. The principal symbol
  \begin{equation}\label{trafo_symbol}
    T_{AB}(k) = E_{A:B}^{\hphantom{A:B}I} J_I^{pq} k_p k_q
  \end{equation}
  of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations $E_A$, where $k \in T^\ast M$ denotes a covector, transforms as a tensor density of weight one, i.e.~an infinitesimal diffeomorphism acts as
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_\xi T_{AB}(k) = - T_{AB}(k) \xi^m_{,m} - T_{CB}(k) \gmc{C}{A}{n}{m} \xi^m_{,n} - T_{AC}(k) \gmc{C}{B}{n}{m} \xi^m_{,n}.
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  The idea of the proof is as before: We insert the just proven transformation behaviour of the Euler-Lagrange equations $E_A$ and of covectors $k$, which is
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_\xi k_a = - k_m \xi^n_{,a},
  \end{equation}
  into the transformation
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      \delta_\xi T_{AB}(k) &{} = (T_{AB}(k))_{:C} \delta_\xi u^C + (T_{AB}(k))_{:C}^{\hphantom{:C}p} \delta_\xi u^C_{\hphantom Cp} + (T_{AB}(k))_{:C}^{\hphantom{:C}I} \delta_\xi u^C_{\hphantom CI} \\
                           &{} \hphantom{=} + \frac{\partial T_{AB}}{\partial k_a}(k) \delta_\xi k_a.
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  This time, the calculation is rather trivial and the claim \eqref{trafo_symbol} follows almost immediately.
\end{proof}
We are now in a position to prove the first part of the central result, which is that the principal polynomial of area metric gravity is a scalar density. Note that we restrict our considerations to the case of a principal symbol that is independent from the derivatives of the derivatives of the gravitational field, as otherwise the causality could not be matched anyway (see Sect.~\ref{section_axiom2_perturb}).
\begin{theorem}\label{thm_poly_trafo}
  Let $\pi$ be the area metric bundle. Conside a degenerate Lagrangian field theory with a principal symbol that is independent from the derivatives of the area metric field. The principal polynomial $\mathcal P(k)$ corresponding to the symbol, as defined in Def.~\ref{def_principal_polynomial} is a scalar density of weight 23, i.e.~transforms locally under infinitesimal spacetime diffeomorphisms as\footnote{Here, we correct a numerical---but inconsequential---error in the calculation presented in Ref.~\cite{paper}, where the factor was calculated to be 57 instead of 23.}
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_\xi \mathcal P(k) = -23 \cdot \mathcal P(k) \xi^m_{,m}.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  From the transformation behaviour of the area metric field and covectors, it follows that an infinitesimal diffeomorphism acts on generators $\chi^A_{(i)}(k) = \gmc{A}{B}{n}{i} u^B k_n$ of gauge transforms as
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_\xi \chi^A_{(i)}(k) = \gmc{A}{B}{n}{m} \chi^B_{(i)}(k) \xi^m_{,n} - \chi^A_{(m)}(k)\xi^m_{,i}.
  \end{equation}
  Now calculating the transformation behaviour of the principal polynomial numerator $Q^{(A_1\dots A_4)(B_1\dots B_4)}$ (dropping the covector $k$ from the notation) we obtain
  \begin{equation}\label{Q_trafo}
    \begin{aligned}
      \delta_\xi Q^{(A_1\dots A_4)(B_1\dots B_4)} &{} = \delta_\xi \frac{\partial^4 \operatorname{det} T}{\partial T_{A_1B_1}\dots\partial T_{A_4B_4}} \\
                                                  &{} = \delta_\xi \left\lbrack \frac{4}{21!} \epsilon^{A_1\dots A_{21}} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} T_{A_5B_5} \dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}}\right\rbrack \\
                                                  &{} = \frac{4\cdot 17}{21!} \epsilon^{A_1\dots A_{21}} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} \lbrack\delta_\xi T_{A_5B_5}\rbrack T_{A_6B_6}\dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \\
                                                  &{} = -17\cdot \delta_\xi Q^{(A_1\dots A_4)(B_1\dots B_4)} \xi^m_{,m} \\
                                                  &{} \hphantom{=} -\frac{4\cdot 17}{21!} \epsilon^{A_1\dots A_{21}} \gmc{A}{A_5}{n}{m} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} T_{AB_5} \dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n} \\
                                                  &{} \hphantom{=} -\frac{4\cdot 17}{21!} \epsilon^{A_1\dots A_{21}} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} \gmc{B}{B_5}{n}{m} T_{A_5B} \dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n}.
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  This is further simplified using the identity $0 = \epsilon^{\lbrack A_1\dots A_{21}} X^{A\rbrack\dots}$, from which we derive after a few index relabellings
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      0 &{} = 22 \cdot \epsilon^{\lbrack A_1\dots A_{21}} \gmc{A\rbrack}{A_5}{n}{m} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_21} T_{AB_5}T_{A_6B_6}\dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n} \\
        &{} = 17 \cdot \epsilon^{A_1\dots A_{21}} \gmc{A}{A_5}{n}{m} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} T_{AB_5}T_{A_6B_6}\dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n} \\
        &{} \hphantom{=} - \gmc{A}{A}{n}{m} \epsilon^{A_1\dots A_{21}}\epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} T_{A_5B_5}\dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n} \\
        &{} \hphantom{=} + \epsilon^{AA_2A_3A_4\dots A_{21}} \gmc{A_1}{A}{n}{m} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} T_{A_5B_5}T_{A_6B_6}\dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n} \\
        &{} \hphantom{=} + \epsilon^{A_1AA_3A_4\dots A_{21}} \gmc{A_2}{A}{n}{m} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} T_{A_5B_5}T_{A_6B_6}\dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n} \\
        &{} \hphantom{=} + \epsilon^{A_1A_2AA_4\dots A_{21}} \gmc{A_3}{A}{n}{m} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} T_{A_5B_5}T_{A_6B_6}\dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n} \\
        &{} \hphantom{=} + \epsilon^{A_1A_2A_3A\dots A_{21}} \gmc{A_4}{A}{n}{m} \epsilon^{B_1\dots B_{21}} T_{A_5B_5}T_{A_6B_6}\dots T_{A_{21}B_{21}} \xi^m_{,n}. \\
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Applying the same technique to the index set $[B_1\dots B_{21} B]$ and carrying out the contraction $\gmc{A}{A}{n}{m} = 4\delta^{n}_{m}$, the identity can be applied to the second and third terms in Eq.~\ref{Q_trafo}, such that we finally obtain
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}

    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Putting both numerator and denominator together proves the claim
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_\xi \mathcal P(k) = -23 \cdot \mathcal P(k) \xi^m_{,m}.
  \end{equation}
\end{proof}
An equivalent formulation of the fact that $\mathcal P(k)$ is a density of weight 23 is that the symmetric coefficients\footnote{Recall that the principal polynomial for area metric gravity is homogeneous and of degree 26.} $P^{a_1\dots a_{26}}$ constitute a tensor density of the same weight, i.e.~live of the bundle of symmetric tensor densities of contravariant rank 26 with weight 23. For this geometry, the equivariance equations on the ``zeroth jet bundle'' (since the polynomial must not depend on derivatives of the geometry) are
\begin{equation}\label{polynomial_equivariance_eqns}
  \begin{aligned}
    P^{a_1\dots a_{26}}_{\hphantom{a_1\dots a_{26}},m} &{} = 0, \\
    P^{a_1\dots a_{26}}_{\hphantom{a_1\dots a_{26}}:A} \gmc{A}{B}{n}{m} u^B &{} = - 23\cdot P^{a_1\dots a_{26}} \delta^n_m + 26\cdot P^{n(a_1\dots a_{25}} \delta^{a_{26})}_m.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The second part of the central result follows from these equations. All we have to do is construct the perturbative solution to first order and see that it is impossible \emph{not} to have the causality match GLED causality to the same order.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\mathcal P_\text{area}$ be the principal polynomial of area metric gravity as considered in Thm.~\ref{thm_poly_trafo}. To first order in the expansion $G = N + H$ of the area metric field, where $N$ is the Lorentz invariant expansion point \eqref{area_expansion_point}, $\mathcal P_\text{area}$ is equivalent to the GLED principal polynomial $\mathcal P_\text{GLED}$ in the sense that
  \begin{equation}\label{eq_thm_poly}
    \mathcal P_\text{area} = \lbrack \omega P_\text{GLED}^{(\leq 1)}\rbrack^{13} + \mathcal O(H^2),
  \end{equation}
  where $\omega$ denotes a density of weight $\frac{23}{13}$ on the area metric bundle and $P_\text{GLED}^{(\leq 1)}$ is the expansion of the GLED polynomial to first order. In particular, to first order in the perturbation, both principal polynomials describe the same null surfaces and hyperbolicity cones.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Knowing that the principal polynomial of area metric gravity transforms as a density of weight 23, we can construct possible candidates by solving the equivariance equations \eqref{polynomial_equivariance_eqns}. To this end, we make the ansatz
  \begin{equation}\label{poly_ansatz}
    \begin{aligned}
      \mathcal P_\text{area}(k) &{} = \eta(k,k)^{13} \\
                                &{} \hphantom{=} + A\cdot \epsilon(H) \eta(k,k)^{13} + B\cdot \eta(H) \eta(k,k)^{13} + C\cdot H(k,k)\eta(k,k)^{12} \\
                                &{} \hphantom{=} + \mathcal O(H^2).
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
An overall factor would be irrelevant, so it has already been dropped when setting the coefficient of the constant term to 1. The generality of the ansatz can, as always, be verified by calculating the corank of the ansatz equations, which will yield 4---the number of ansatz tensors in Eq.~\eqref{poly_ansatz}. Evaluating the equivariance equation at the ansatz and contracting the 26 symmetric indices with covector components, for the sake of a cleaner presentation, yields an equation where we can cancel a common factor of $\eta(k,k)^{(12)}$. The remaining equation has a covariant and a contravariant spacetime index, such that a decomposition into the trace
\begin{equation}
  0 = \lbrack 24 A + 12 B + 3 C + 23 - \frac{13}{2}\rbrack \delta^n_m
\end{equation}
and the tracefree part
\begin{equation}
  0 = \lbrack 4 C - 26\rbrack [\eta^{na}\delta^b_m k_a k_b - \frac{1}{4} \delta^n_m\eta(k,k)]
\end{equation}
lends itself for a first attempt in order to retrieve scalar equations for the system. As it turns out, these two equations are already maximal. Parameterizing the solution with $B$ yields
\begin{equation}\label{general_area_metric_gravity_poly}
  \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal P_\text{area}(k) &{} = \eta(k,k)^{13} \\
                              &{} \hphantom{=} - \frac{3}{2} \epsilon(H)\eta(k,k)^{13} + B(\eta(H)-\frac{1}{2}\epsilon(H))\eta(k)^{13} + \frac{13}{2} H(k,k)\eta(k,k)^{12} \\ 
                              &{} \hphantom{=} + \mathcal O(H^2) \\
                              &{} = \left\{ \left\lbrack 1 - \frac{3}{2\cdot 13} \epsilon(H) + \frac{B}{13}\left(\eta(H) - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon(H) \right)\right\rbrack \eta(k,k) + \frac{1}{2} H(k,k) \right\}^{13} \\
                              &{} \hphantom{=} + \mathcal O(H^2),
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where for the last equality we completed the thirteenth power as
\begin{equation}
  1 + \epsilon = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{13}\epsilon\right)^{13} + \mathcal O(\epsilon^2).
\end{equation}

In order to relate the quadratic polynomial that determines the first order of $\mathcal P_\text{area}(k)$ to $\mathcal P_\text{GLED}^{(\leq 1)}$ via a scalar density, as claimed in Eq.~\eqref{eq_thm_poly}, we consider the equivariance equations
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \omega_{,m} &{} = 0, \\
    \omega_{:A} \gmc{A}{B}{n}{m} u^B &{} = -\frac{23}{13}\,\omega \delta^n_m
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
for such a density $\omega$ of weight $\frac{23}{13}$. This time, the Lorentz invariant ansatz is just
\begin{equation}
  \omega = 1 + A\cdot \epsilon(H) + B\cdot \eta(H) + \mathcal O(H^2)
\end{equation}
and reduces the equivariance equations to the single condition
\begin{equation}
  24A + 12B = -\frac{23}{13},
\end{equation}
such that the most general scalar density of weight $\frac{23}{13}$ is to first order given by
\begin{equation}
  \omega = 1 - \frac{23}{13\cdot 24} \epsilon(H) + B \lbrack \eta(H) - \frac{1}{2} \epsilon(H)\rbrack + \mathcal O(H^2).
\end{equation}
The result now follows from multiplication of $\mathcal P_\text{area}^{(\leq 1)}$ with $\omega$, which yields exactly the area metric gravity polynomial \eqref{general_area_metric_gravity_poly}. To first order, the principal polynomial of area metric gravity is determined by a quadratic polynomial which reduces to the quadratic first-order GLED polynomial \emph{up to a factor}. Because such an overall factor is irrelevant for vanishing sets and hyperbolicity cones, the polynomials must be considered identical for the purpose of comparing their causal structure.
\end{proof}

Having fixed the causality of third-order perturbative area metric gravity---by proof, rather than by explicit calculation---the construction procedure up to this order is completed. Third-order area metric gravity\footnote{With second-order field equations and, therefore, a principal polynomial of first order.} is determined by the ansatz \eqref{ansatz_area_gravity} which is constructed from the Lorentz-invariant basis tensors \eqref{???}. From the 237 gravitational constants---the coefficients in the basis expansion---50 constants turn out to be independent, 11 of which govern the linearized field equations. The relations between gravitational constants are collected in Appendix \ref{}. In the following, we will examine the linear theory, which forms the basis for predicting first-order and, later on, second-order effects of area metric gravity.
