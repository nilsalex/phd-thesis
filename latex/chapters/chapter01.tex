\section{The r\^ole of gravity in physics}
As the title suggests, this thesis is primarily concerned with \emph{gravity}. In the ensemble of physical theories, gravity plays a special r\^ole. It serves a different purpose than the theories we will call \emph{matter theories}. The latter are subject to direct observations: photons---quanta of the electomagnetic field---hit the observers retina, allowing her to make inferences about the source of the particles. Charged fermions---again quanta of a corresponding matter field---induce signals in a semiconductor detector. Specific signatures in the signals may be associated with certain events that contributed to the production of the incident fermions, such that the statistics of these observations is able to falsify hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms.

How does gravity fit into this picture? The revolution of a binary star about its centre of mass, commonly known to be caused by gravity, is not observed directly. Neither are its gravitational spin-up and eventual merger. Rather, the stars emit photons that are picked up by the astronomer, who concludes details about the trajectories. When the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations announced the first observation of gravitational waves \cite{ligo}, the ground-breaking detection was earth-bound, but in a certain sense not \emph{direct}: it amounts to the analysis of interference patterns from photons that bounced off of mirrors at the end of the detector arms. General relativity predicts that these arms should expand and contract under the influence of incident gravitational waves. Eventually, the signature in the interference pattern was found to match the predictions for a binary black hole merger.

The gravitational field, in turn, provides the background on which matter fields propagate. Together, this yields a highly accurate fundamental description of the universe.}
\end{figure}

From this point of view, gravity sets the stage for the propagation of matter fields. This is witnessed by the dynamics for matter fields, one example of which is the electromagnetic potential in Maxwell electrodynamics. Its field equations are derived from the action functional
\begin{equation*}
  S_\text{Maxwell}\lbrack A\rbrack = \int\mathrm d^4x \sqrt{-g} g^{ac} g^{bc} F_{ab} F_{cd},
\end{equation*}
which depends on the potential $A$ via the field strength tensor $F = \mathrm dA$. Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field has been a huge success as it is the foundation of many applications throughout science. The quantum field theories for the electromagnetic field and similar gauge theories, together with the fermonic sector, form the standard model of particle physics (SMPP), which is widely regarded as the most precisely tested physical theory\footnote{For example, the magnetic moment of the electron has been measured as $g/2 = 1.001\,159\,652\,180\,73(28)$. \cite{http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.83.052122} Its value as proposed by quantum electrodynamics has been calculated as $g/2 = 1.001\,159\,652\,182\,03(73)$ \cite{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.96.019901}. Both the experimentally measured value and the value calculated from quantum electrodynamics agree to more than 12 significant figures.}. Still, these matter theories presuppose knowledge of the spacetime metric $g$ which enters the action for the electromagnetic field above and contributes to other theories of the SMPP in a similar way. Consequently, the SMPP alone lacks \emph{predictivity}: collecting initial data of all physical fields is not enough for the physicist in order to determine the fields in the future, since the metric tensor has to be specified externally. 

One of the many great contributions by Einstein was the prescription of field equations that govern the dynamics of the metric tensor. \cite{einstein_gr} This theory is called \emph{general relativity} and may be derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action functional
\begin{equation*}
  S_\text{Einstein-Hilbert}\lbrack g\rbrack = \int\mathrm \mathrm d^4x \sqrt{-g} R.
\end{equation*}
Einstein's theory provides the missing link between matter and gravity, completing the SMPP to the joint model of SMPP and general relativity sketched in Fig.~\ref{figure_smpp_gr}, which is now predictive. It has also been verified numerous times, both via astronomical observations and \emph{in terra}\footnote{earthbound} experiments, albeit to a lesser degree of certainty\footnote{Only four significant figures of the gravitational constant are known. \cite{https://doi.org/10.1103/FRevModPhys.88.035009} Measurements with higher precision yield conflicting results. \cite{https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.84.1527}}.

Of course, the division of physical theories into matter theories and gravity is only a \emph{metaphysical} notion. Both make testable predictions about the outcome of experiments; both have been shown to accurately describe reality in a variety of circumstances. But exactly in this metaphysical idea lies the mindset of \emph{constructive gravity}, which seeks to address the search for other (more?) complete pictures of matter and gravity.

\section{Modified gravity from refined matter theories}
Under certain assumptions, Einstein's general relativity is the unique theory that completes the SMPP to a predictive theory of matter and gravity.\cite{lovelock,hkt,deser} The only two unknown parameters that need to be fixed are Newton's gravitational constant and the cosmological constant. This remarkable finding constrains the search for modified theories of gravity: if the mentioned assumptions are taken for granted, the standard model of particle physics can only be completed by general relativity. It is, however, well established that the joint theory of the SMPP and Einstein gravity cannot be universal, due to several inconsistencies.

One example are extreme circumstances, such as the beginning of the universe or the presence of black holes, where the whole formalism breaks down \cite{}. This is one of the justifications for the efforts of finding a quantum theory of gravity.

Even in more benign situations, the observations do not always coincide with the predictions from the SMPP and general relativity. The observed rotation curves of galaxies, for example, do not match the expectations calculated from the visible matter distributions. Starting from a certain minimum distance from the galaxy centre, stars and other matter content rotate with higher velocities than expected. \cite{} This discrepancy generally increases with the radius. \cite{} All proposed solutions \cite{} that may cure this inconsistency have one thing in common---they modify or extend the currently accepted theories of matter and gravity.

There are more observations \cite{} that demonstrate the need for modifications. However such adjustments play out, they are constrained by the uniqueness of Einstein's general relativity in one of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Additional or modified matter fields that make use of the same metric tensor $g$ as the existing matter theories will still couple to general relativity.
  \item Additional or modified matter fields that couple to new geometry---e.g.~a second metric tensor or a tensor of higher rank---render general relativity as theory for a single metric tensor meaningless. A completely new description of gravity is needed, \emph{which may be subject to similar uniqueness theorems}.
  \item Modifications to general realativity itself are incompatible with the uniqueness theorem. This means that either the assumptions from which uniqueness follows must be dropped or that the matter theories have to be modified accordingly---if at all possible.
\end{enumerate}
All three approaches are pursued, as they should be for a systematic search of modified theories. Constructive gravity, the subject of this thesis, is a framework for the structured treatment of approach number two. In most regards, its assumptions are very conservative, as it tries to deviate only ever so slightly from the established models. For example, where standard general relativity is restricted to field equations of second derivative, constructive gravity keeps this restriction. This is not because other efforts are not deemed worthwile---they certainly are, but different approaches towards modified gravity research should be explored \emph{ceteris paribus}, only making one change at a time. The focus of constructive gravity lies on novel matter theories coupling to nonmetric geometries and the corresponding gravitational implications \emph{within the existing meta-theory of classical physics}. Most importantly, because the framework is kept so close to the standard models, a similar uniqueness theorem can be derived for nonmetric geometries. It will not be as strong as for the SMPP and general relativity, but nevertheless provide a useful parameterization of modified theories of gravity that fall into the second category.

As far as the framework is concerned, any matter theory that satisfies certain formal requirements (e.g.~has field equations of second derivative order) is fair game. The relevance of this framework, however, crucially depends on the kind of matter theory that is chosen. A complete overhaul of physics is generally not desired---the existing models work very well in certain sectors. Any new theory must reproduce this phenomenology in order to be epistemically significant. For this reason, constructive gravity is considered as a tool that guides the construction of modified gravity from \emph{refined} matter theories.

  \caption{Rationale of constructive gravity. The matter theory $S_\text{matter}$, which couples the matter field $\phi$ to some geometry $G$, determines the structure of the gravitational theory $S_\text{gravity}$. In general, this result will not be unique but parameterized, which results in a lot of candidates. Via the interdependence of matter and gravity, each candidate yields phenomenology that can be used by the observer for tests of the theory.}
