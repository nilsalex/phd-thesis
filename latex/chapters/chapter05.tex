\chapter{Outlook: symmetry-reduced constructive gravity}

\textbf{take-home message: covariant constructive gravity offers a way to directly construct symmetry-reduced theory without having to construct the full theory beforehand}

\section{The cosmological bundle}
\begin{itemize}
\item idea: symmetric field parameterized by vector fields and scalar (densities)
\item examples: metric theory, area metric theory
\end{itemize}

\section{Recovering the FLRW model}
\begin{itemize}
\item equivariance equations on cosmological bundle for symmetric metric are solved by Friedmann equations
\end{itemize}

\section{Construction equations for area metric cosmology}
\begin{itemize}
\item set up equivariance equations for area metric cosmological bundle
\item proof: matter causality is metric
\end{itemize}
