\chapter{The construction algorithm}

\textit{Having introduced the axioms of covariant constructive gravity and cast them in precise mathematical language, we consolidate the results and state the algorithm for the construction of modified gravity Lagrangians from novel matter theories. After a discussion about practical implications in general, we proceed with sketching the application to a few examples.}

\section{General formulation}

The results obtained so far allow us to formulate a comprehensive algorithm for the construction of gravitational Lagrangians. These Lagrangians are the most general conceivable Lagrangians within our formalism that satisfy both axioms of covariant constructive gravity. All that has to be provided is a matter theory that couples to geometry and the algorithm will yield all candidates for gravitational theories that determine the so far undetermined dynamics of the gravitational field, finally giving the theory predictive power. In this sense, the task of searching for modified gravitational theories boils down to the solution of specific PDE systems of a simple form and algebraic equations concerning the causal structure of gravity.

\end{algorithm}

Let us comment on the algorithm step by step: The first step, calculating the Gotay-Marsden coefficients, is trivial. The coefficients follow from the prescribed or inherited action of diffeomorphisms on the geometry bundle. For purely covariant or contravariant tensor bundles, Prop.~\ref{prop_gmc_intertwiner} already gives the final expression. These coefficients have to be inserted into Eqns.~\ref{equivariance_eqn_1}--\ref{equivariance_eqn_4} in order to execute step 2. As a result, we obtain a system of linear, first-order partial differential equations for the Lagrangian density $L$ with coefficients that are linear in the independent variables. More precisely, the PDEs are of the form
\begin{equation}
  0 = A^j_i x^i u_{,j} + B u,
\end{equation}
$u$ is the dependent variable, $x^i$ are the independent variables and the coefficients $A^j_i$ and $B$ are constants. Conceptually, it is clear how to solve such PDEs\cite{seiler}, albeit in most cases practically infeasible, due to the sheer size of the system and the number of independent variables. However, as we will see in a later chapter, the system admits a property called \emph{involutivity}, from which we can infer strong results about solutions and derive a perturbative solution strategy.

For a known solution, it is only a matter of applying Eq.~\ref{euler_lagrange_local} to the Lagrangian in order to compute the Euler-Lagrange equations for step 4. Restricting to second-derivative-order field equations, as required by step 5, could be done now by imposing that higher-derivative-order terms vanish. In practice, however, such restrictions will be placed at an earlier stage, in order to rule out higher orders from the beginning. A similar pattern emerges for steps 6 and 7: placing restrictions on the computed entities is possible, but may be hard to enforce after the fact. So it is worth keeping this requirement in mind early on.

\section{Example: Einstein gravity}

As already outlined in the introduction, Einstein gravity can be thought of as the gravitational closure of Maxwell electrodynamics in four dimensions. This theory provides dynamics for sections $A$ in the bundle $T^\ast M$ of one-forms, parameterized with sections $g$ in the bundle $S(T^2_0M)$ of contravariant\footnote{Many descriptions regard the covariant inverse metric as fundamental. In this case, the contravariant metric tensor appearing in the Lagrangian density \eqref{maxwell_lagrangian} is the inverse of the metric field. Both descriptions will yield slightly differing intermediate results during the construction procedure, but are fundamentally equivalent.} symmetric tensors of rank two. $A$ is commonly known as the \emph{electromagnetic potential}, $g$ as the \emph{metric tensor}. The dynamics of the electromagnetic field is given by the Lagrangian density
\begin{equation}
  L_\text{Maxwell} = \sqrt{-\operatorname{det} g} g^{ac}g^{bd} F_{ab} F_{cd},
\end{equation}
where the electromagnetic potential enters via the field strength tensor $F = \mathrm dA$.

We now collect the ingredients for the construction algorithm. The fibre dimension of the bundle $S(T^2_0M)$ is 10, such that a suitable pair of intertwiners $(I,J)$ between this bundle and the unrestricted tensor bundle $T^2M$ is given by
\begin{equation}

and

    J_{ab}^9 = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0\end{pmatrix}_{ab}, J_{ab}^{10} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}_{ab}.
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
The intertwiner $I$ distributes the ten degrees of freedom for a symmetric tensor of dimension 4 across the components of a generic rank-2 tensor
\begin{equation}
  I^{ab}(c_Au^A) = \begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 & c_3 & c_4 \\ c_2 & c_5 & c_6 & c_7 \\ c_3 & c_6 & c_8 & c_9 \\ c_4 & c_7 & c_9 & c_{10}\end{pmatrix}^{ab},
\end{equation}
while $J$ projects such symmetrically distributed components back to the ten degrees of freedom, discarding possible antisymmetric contributions.

Prop.~\ref{prop_gmc_intertwiner} yields the Gotay-Marsden intertwiner from $(I,J)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \gmc{A}{B}{n}{m} = -2 I^{pn}_B J^A_{pm}.
\end{equation}
Contracting with $I$ and $J$ yields the spacetime expression
\begin{equation}
  \gmc{ab}{cd}{n}{m} = -2 \delta^{(a}_m \delta^{b)}_{(c} \delta^n_{d)},
\end{equation}
which serves as a good sanity check: Contracting again with a metric $g$ and the derivatives of a vector field $\xi$ results in the well-known transformation of $g$ w.r.t.~infinitesimal diffeomorphism generated by $\xi$,
\begin{equation}
  \gmc{ab}{cd}{n}{m} g^{cd} \xi^m_n = -2g^{n(a} \xi^{b)}_{,n}.
