\chapter{Covariant constructive gravity}

\textbf{take-home message: two conditions on gravitational dynamics determined by coupled matter theory}


This chapter is concerned with the two axioms of covariant constructive gravity. Their informal formulation is as follows:
\begin{axiom}[Diffeomorphism invariance]
  The dynamical laws that govern gravity are invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms. \cite{cgg paper}
\end{axiom}
\begin{axiom}[Causal compatibility]
  Provided that spacetime is additionally inhabited by matter fields, their dynamics is causally compatible with the gravitational dynamics. \cite{cgg paper}
\end{axiom}

For a more precise formulation of the axioms, which will enable us to derive their consequences for gravitational theories coupled to novel matter, an introduction of the basic concepts of Lagrangian field theory is in order.

\section{Lagrangian field theory}

\begin{definition}{(Lagrangian)}
  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$ and $E \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} M$ a smooth fibre bundle over $M$ with typical fibre $F$. A \textbf{Lagrangian} $\mathcal L$ of order $k$ is an element
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal L \in \textstyle\bigwedge^n_0\pi_k,
  \end{equation}
the space of horizontal $n$-forms on the $k$-th-order jet bundle $\pi_k$ of $\pi$.

  Assuming $M$ to be orientable with volume form $\Omega\in\bigwedge^n\tau_M^\ast$, a Lagrangian $\mathcal L$ is equivalently characterized by its \textbf{Lagrangian density} $L\in C^\infty(J^k\pi)$,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal L = L\pi_k^\ast\Omega.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

From now on, we will consider smooth, orientable base manifolds $M$ and smooth bundles over the base manifold. Depending on the context, the symbol $\Omega$ will denote either the form on $M$ or the pullback to various bundles over $M$.

\begin{definition}{(local action functional)}
  Given a Lagrangian density $\mathcal L \in \bigwedge^n_0\pi_k$ and a compact $n$-dimensional submanifold $C \subset M$, the \textbf{local action functional} is defined as the map
  \begin{equation}
    \phi \mapsto S\lbrack\phi\rbrack = \int_C (j^k\phi)^\ast\mathcal L
  \end{equation}
for all local sections $\phi$ of $\pi$ with support on $C$.
\end{definition}

Lagrangian field theory now stipulates that sections $\phi\in\Gamma(\pi)$ are physical if they are stationary points of the action functional. A well-known result from the calculus of variations is the following:
\begin{proposition}
  Let $L\in C^\infty(J^k\pi)$ be a Lagrangian density. Let $C$ be a compact submanifold of $M$ and $\phi$ be a local section of $\pi$ such that the local action functional $S\lbrack\phi\rbrack$ is defined. If $\phi$ is an extremal of $S$, it satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equations
  \begin{equation}\label{euler_lagrange_local}
    (j^{2k}\phi)^\ast\left( \sum_{l=0}^{k} (-1)^l D_{i_1} \cdots D_{i_l} \frac{\partial L}{\partial u^A_{i_1\cdots i_l}}\right) = 0.
  \end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  See Saunders 1989 or older, original work
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  Given a Lagrangian $\mathcal L = L\Omega \in \bigwedge^n_0\pi_k$, there exists an $n+1$ form $\Theta_L\in\bigwedge^{n}_0\pi_{2k-1,k-1}\cap\bigwedge^{n}_{1}\pi_{2k-1}$, such that, globally, the variation of the Lagrangian is given by
  \begin{equation}\label{global_lagrange_form}
    \delta L = \pi^\ast_{2k,k} \left( dL\wedge\Omega\right) + d_h \Theta_L
  \end{equation}
  and extremals of $\mathcal L$ are extremals of $\Theta_L$ in the sense that
  \begin{equation}
    \pi_{2k-1,k}^\ast (j^k\phi)^\ast\mathcal L = (j^{2k-1}\phi)^\ast\Theta_L.
  \end{equation}
  Such a form $\Theta_L$ is called a \textbf{Cartan form}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  See Saunders 1989 or older, original work
\end{proof}

This definition generalizes the local derivation of (\ref{euler_lagrange_local}): The variation $\delta L$ is obtained by lifting $d\mathcal L$ to $\pi_{2k}$ and cancelling non-horizontal terms (over $E$) by adding a derivative, which corresponds to repeated integrations by parts.

A coordinate expression for $\Theta_L$ is
\begin{equation}\label{local_cartan_form}
  \Theta_L = L\Omega + \sum_{s=0}^{k-1} \sum_{l=0}^{k-s-1} (-1)^l D_{i_1} \cdots D_{i_l} \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial u^A_{j i_1 \dots i_{l} p_1 \dots p_s}}\right) \psi^A_{p_1\dots p_s} \wedge \left(i_{\partial_j}\Omega\right).
\end{equation}
The forms $\psi^A_{p_1\dots p_s} = du^A_{p_1\dots p_s} - u^A_{p_1\dots p_sq} dx^q$ span the contact system of $J^k\pi$.

Straight-forward application of (\ref{global_lagrange_form}) to (\ref{local_cartan_form}) yields the well-known coordinate expression
\begin{equation}
  \delta L = \left( \sum_{l=0}^{k} (-1)^l D_{i_1} \cdots D_{i_l} \frac{\partial L}{\partial u^A_{i_1\cdots i_l}}\right) u^A \wedge \Omega
\end{equation}
for the Euler-Lagrange form.

In later sections, we will restrict our attention to Lagrangians of second derivative order. As it turns out, the Cartan form for such a theory is \emph{unique}.
\begin{proposition}
  The Cartan form is unique for second-order Lagrangians.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  See Saunders 1989 or older, original work
\end{proof}

\section{Axiom I: diffeomorphism invariance}

In the language of jet bundles, the first axiom can be formalized as equivariance condition on the Lagrangian. We will restrict our attention here to tensorial field theories of second derivative order.

\begin{definition}
  A Lagrangian on the second jet bundle over a sub-bundle of some tensor bundle is called a \textbf{tensorial field theory of second (derivative) order}.
\end{definition}

By virtue of the pushforward-pullback construction, sub-bundles of tensor bundles carry a canonical action of the diffeomorphism group $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ as bundle automorphisms, denoted as $\varphi_E\in \mathrm{Aut}(E)$ for every $\varphi\in\mathrm{Diff}(M)$. We call this the \emph{lift} of the diffeomorphism $\varphi$. This action, in turn, lifts naturally to the jet bundles over $E$.

\begin{definition}[prolongation of morphisms]
  Let $E \overset{\pi_E}{\longrightarrow} M$ and $H \overset{\pi_H}{\longrightarrow} N$ be two bundles. The $k$th-order jet bundle lift of a bundle morphism $(F,f)$ from $\pi_E$ to $\pi_H$ is the unique bundle morphism $(j^k(F),f)$ from $J^k\pi_E$ to $J^k\pi_H$ that lets the diagram in Fig.~(??) commute.
\end{definition}
A proof for the existence and uniqueness of this construction can be found in Ref.~\cite{saunders}. With the notion of the \emph{lift} of a bundle automorphism at hand, we now give the first axiom a precise meaning
\begin{definition}[diffeomorphism invariant theory]
  A Lagrangian field theory is called \textbf{diffeomorphism invariant} if its Lagrangian $\mathcal L\in\textstyle\bigwedge_0^n\pi_k$ is invariant with respect to the lifted action of $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ on $J^kE$, i.e.~ if for all $\varphi\in\mathrm{Diff}(M)$
  \begin{equation}\label{lagrangian_diffeo_invariance}
    j^k(\varphi_E)^\ast \mathcal L = \mathcal L.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
This definition applies to other bundles and groups as well, as long as the action on the total space is defined.

Using a local representation $\mathcal L = L d^nx$, the diffeomorphism invariance condition (\ref{lagrangian_diffeo_invariance}) translates into an equivariance condition on the Lagrangian density
\begin{equation}\label{lagrangian_density_diffeo_equivariance}
  L \circ j^k(\varphi_E) = \lvert D\varphi\rvert^{-1} L,
\end{equation}
where $\lvert D\varphi\rvert$ denotes the determinant of the Jacobian $D\varphi$. Covariant constructive gravity derives its calculational power from the observation that (\ref{lagrangian_density_diffeo_equivariance}) is locally equivalent to a system of linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for the Lagrangian density $L$. For this theorem and the remainder of the chapter, we will work on the second jet bundle, as we are ultimately interested in investigating field theories of second derivative order.
\begin{theorem}
  Let $L$ be the local Lagrangian density of a second derivative order Lagrangian $\mathcal L = Ld^4x \in \textstyle\bigwedge_0^n\pi_2$. If $\mathcal L$ is diffeomorphism invariant, i.e.~satisfies the invariance condition (\ref{lagrangian_diffeo_invariance}) of the first axiom of covariant constructive gravity, its local representation $L$ satisfies a system of first-order linear partial differential equations given by
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      0 &{} = L_{\colon m} \\
      0 &{} = L_{\colon m} \\
    \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
