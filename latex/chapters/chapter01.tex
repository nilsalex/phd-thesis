\chapter{Introduction to the constructive gravity programme}

\section{The conception of general relativity}

\begin{itemize}
\item general relativity as closure of Maxwell electrodynamics
\item uniqueness (different derivations and proofs)
\item modified gravity, how this is compatible to uniqueness
\end{itemize}

\section{Modified gravity from refined matter theories}

\begin{itemize}
\item motto: matter tells gravity how to curve, gravity tells matter how to move -> lift to theory level
\item 2d plot of theories?
\item what could hint at the existence of refined matter theories?
\item dark matter
\end{itemize}

\section{Canonical and covariant approaches to constructive gravity}

\begin{itemize}
\item canonical approach: implementing the constraint algebra
\item a success story, but does it keep its promises?
\item covariant view: equivalent and complementary
\item simpler?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{game plan: structure of the thesis}
