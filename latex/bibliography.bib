It has extensive functionality for tensor polynomial simplification taking care of Bianchi and Schouten identities, for fermions and anti-commuting variables, Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate dependence, multiple index types and many other field theory related concepts. The input format is a subset of TeX and thus easy to learn. Both a command-line and a graphical interface are available. The present paper is an introduction to the program using several concrete problems from gravity, supergravity and quantum field theory.},

The resulting eleven-parameter family of weak gravitational field equations allows to predict where vacuum birefringence will occur, if there is any.},

  title       = {Gravitational effects in birefringent quantum electrodynamics},
  abstract    = {The most general classical electrodynamics which still respect the linear superposition principle but allow for otherwise arbitrary birefringence require, and imply, a refined spacetime geometry described by a fourth-rank tensor field. Canonical gravitational dynamics for this geometry, if required to co-evolve in causally consistent fashion with the electromagnetic field, were shown to be constructively determined by gravitational closure of the birefringent electromagnetic field equations. For weak gravitational fields of the resulting birefringent refinement of classical Einstein-Maxwell theory, we show in this article that the corresponding quantum electrodynamics is locally renormalizable at every loop order in gauge-invariant fashion and then employ this result to compute various fundamental processes. Combining quantum field theoretic results in locally essentially flat regions with the global spacetime structure predicted by the refined gravitational dynamics, we find that the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, the cross sections of Bhabha scattering, and the hyperfine splitting of the hydrogen all pick up a dependence on position in the gravitational field. Particularly the measurement of the hyperfine line of hydrogen, but quite generally the measurement of any local quantum electrodynamical process, is thus able to inform the search for vacuum birefringence and its effects in a new way, since the gravitational theory allows to predict where the effects will be most pronounced.},

  abstract      = {This is the first paper of a five part work in which we study the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian structure of classical field theories with constraints. Our goal is to explore some of the connections between initial value constraints and gauge transformations in such theories (either relativistic or not). To do this, in the course of these four papers, we develop and use a number of tools from symplectic and multisymplectic geometry. Of central importance in our analysis is the notion of the ``energy-momentum map'' associated to the gauge group of a given classical field theory. We hope to demonstrate that many different and apparently unrelated facets of field theories can be thereby tied together and understood in an essentially new way. In Part I we develop some of the basic theory of classical fields from a spacetime covariant viewpoint. We begin with a study of the covariant Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, on jet bundles and multisymplectic manifolds, respectively. Then we discuss symmetries, conservation laws, and Noether's theorem in terms of ``covariant momentum maps.''},

The ability to generate code at compile time allows the programmer to implement such features as polytypic programs, macro-like expansion, user directed optimization (such as inlining), and the generation of supporting data structures and functions from existing data structures and functions.

Our design is being implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, ghc.

A detailed proof is given for a theorem describing the most general form of the metric of a homogeneous isotropic space-time. Although this theorem can be considered to be commonly known, its complete proof is difficult to find in the literature. An example metric is presented such that all its spatial cross sections correspond to constant-curvature spaces, but it is not homogeneous and isotropic as a whole. An equivalent definition of a homogeneous and isotropic space-time in terms of embedded manifolds is also given.},
