\chapter{Relation to canonical constructive gravity}

\textbf{take-home message: complementary approach, equations easier to handle, second order already solved, uncovers some shortcomings of canonical approach}

\begin{itemize}
\item relation between diffeo invariance and constraint algebra
\item the role of causality in the constraint algebra
\end{itemize}
