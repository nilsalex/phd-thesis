\chapter{Conclusions}

In this thesis, the concept of covariant constructive gravity has been put on a solid mathematical footing. Lagrangian field theory on jet bundles turned out to be ideally suited for the definition of the general covariance axiom. The equivariance equations that follow from this axiom transform the implementation into a computational task, opening up the \emph{constructive} pathway towards modified theories of gravity. Using the Cartan form that corresponds to a diffeomorphism invariant Lagrangian density, we have seen how general covariance implies a version of the first and second Noether theorem---important results that have proven very useful further down the line. Within this framework, the axiom of causal compatibility has been formulated as additional algebraic conditions on the gravitational field equations.

From the equivariance equations and causality conditions, we derived a concise algorithm which guides the construction of novel gravitational theories that implement general covariance and are causally compatible to a given matter theory. Because this can be seen as generalization of Lovelock's uniqueness theorems for Einstein gravity \cite{Lovelock_1969,Lovelock_1971,Lovelock_1972}, we could show that this construction procedure applied to Maxwell's electrodynamics indeed reproduces metric gravity as derived by Einstein.

Of course, covariant constructive gravity would not be that interesting if it were just another tool that reproduces Einstein gravity. Its \emph{raison d'\^etre} is the derivation of \emph{modified} theories of gravity that complete novel matter theories to predictive models of the universe. The remainder of the thesis was dedicated towards achieving this goal.

First, we have discussed three examples of novel matter theories: birefringent electrodynamics and two bimetric theories. While it is straightforward to set up the construction procedure and derive general results concerning the solution space, \emph{finding} these solutions is notoriously hard and turned out not to be feasible for the examples in question.

\begin{itemize}
\item complements canonical approach
\item impulses for canonical constructive gravity: causality, ans√§tze
\item from new concept to prediction of novel effects
\item conceptual, more work needed for prediction of outcome of high-precision experiments
\item relevance is given regardless of the status of quantum gravity
\end{itemize}
