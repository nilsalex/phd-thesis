\chapter{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item complements canonical approach
\item impulses for canonical constructive gravity: causality, ans√§tze
\item from new concept to prediction of novel effects
\item conceptual, more work needed for prediction of outcome of high-precision experiments
\item relevance is given regardless of the status of quantum gravity
\end{itemize}
